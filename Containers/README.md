# Containers

A container in Docker is a software unit that contains everything needed to run an application, such as code, libraries, tools and the operating system. Containers are self-contained, lightweight and portable, allowing applications to be deployed quickly and reliably in different environments. Docker is an open source platform that makes it easy to create, manage and use containers1. Some common uses of Docker are:

* Develop applications in an isolated and consistent environment.&#x20;
* Test and debug applications on different operating systems and configurations.&#x20;
* Deploy and scale applications in the cloud, on servers or virtual machines.&#x20;
* Distribute and share applications with other developers and users.
